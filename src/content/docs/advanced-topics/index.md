## Smooth, right-sized, and enabled journeys for API doing

Organizations and ecosystems of API consumers and producers are like a buzzing city. For a newcomer to APIs or even the seasoned professionals aiming to uplift their API-game navigating through and understanding what to do and when might become a daunting task. APIOps Cycles helps teams pick the right “metro line” according to their needs.

APIOps Cycles introduces the concept of “metro lines” (processes or workflows) that guide API teams through the relevant capability “stations” depending on the situation. How well the capabilities are enabled by the person/team responsible for that capability dictates how smooth the journey is for the API teams doing the API work.

When the team tries to do the testing for their APIs, the journey through the [API Delivery Line](../lines/delivery-line) is smooth and fast, if the team meets the definition of ready to enter the “Test automation” station. 

Assuming the station capability is enabled by the responsible capability owner, proper tooling and resources are available for performing the API test automation.

Work for enabling capabilities should be prioritized according to the size and complexity of the organization, to ensure the priority “metro lines” or processes are working smoothly, ensuring a better and faster API lifecycle towards the organization's outcomes.

## Grow your API work from a village to a metropolis

For startups or small internal teams, the core lifecycle, the “core metro line,”  made of the core capabilities might suffice. Here, the immediate stakeholders can manage decisions and tasks informally. Communication is direct, and the API team may handle many responsibilities without strict role boundaries. 

Extend the core lifecycle, by choosing one of the thematic lines according to your needs. The lines help manage complexity and collaboration and connect the core “stations” to the “suburbs”.

### As your organization grows, so does the complexity of managing APIs:

- More APIs: As your API portfolio expands, interdependencies and the need for governance increase.
- More teams and stakeholders: Each line—or even each station—may have a dedicated person, team, or business unit responsible. Each will require its skills and capabilities from the team members.
- More guidelines and standards: Larger organizations introduce policies to ensure consistency, but managing these guidelines across teams requires clarity and collaboration.
- More consumers: APIs will serve diverse internal and external consumers, each with unique needs.

:::tip

Switching from the “core line” to additional specialized lines—like [Business Opportunities Line](../lines/business-opportunities-line), [Platform Architecture Line](../lines/platform-architecture-line), or [API Publishing and Adoption Line](../lines/platform-architecture-line) helps address specific challenges and manage this complexity. Use the [Operating Model Line](../lines/operating-model-line) to ensure you scaffolding your people, budgets and processes to secure a scalable API program.
