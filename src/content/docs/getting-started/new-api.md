Go from idea to a well-designed API.

:::

**1. [API Product Strategy](/method/api-product-strategy/)**
- *Customer Journey Canvas* - Map real user needs without fixating on a specific API, first.  This is your opportunity to automate and smoothen the clunky or dated business process. Users don’t want to click through a UI or do multiple extra steps, they just want “stuff to work”. This is where APIs can really help.
- *Domain Canvas* - Align on concepts
- *API Value Proposition Canvas* - Define value, not endpoints and find out if there is an existing API to reuse or buy to fit the need.
- *API Business Model Canvas* - Ensure viability of your potential API product.
- Get familiar with the *API Audit Checklist* (concept phase) to know what is required, and share with your API consumers to get feedback.

**2. [API Consumer Experience](/method/api-consumer-experience/)**
- Validate your plans with your consumers, and plan how to onboard them.

**3. [API Platform Architecture](/method/api-platform-architecture/)**
- *Business Impact Canvas* - Check risks and mitigation needs
- *Capacity Canvas* and *Location Canvas* plan architecture for the right scale

**4. [API Design](/method/api-design/)**
- *Interaction Canvas* - Plan interaction model
- Choose the right interface pattern (*REST Canvas*, *Event Canvas*, *GraphQL Canvas*) based on the API consumer and architecture needs
- Draft the OpenAPI or other contract
- Do the first two phases of the *API Audit Checklist* and share with your API consumers to get feedback.

**5. [API Delivery](/method/api-delivery/)**
- Follow internal CI/CD, test automation, and release practices

**6. Do the full [API Audit](/method/api-audit/)**, usig the *API Audit Checklist* and prepare for publishing your API

**7. [API Publishing](/method/api-publishing/)**
- Expose APIs securely and clearly to the right audience with the right documentation and processes.

**8. [Monitoring and Improvements](/method/monitoring-and-improving/)**
- Use metrics and feedback to track API performance and drive continuous improvement.
