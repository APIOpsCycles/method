## API Style Guide 

This guide outlines best practices and standards for designing and implementing RESTful APIs to ensure security, consistency, usability, and alignment with organizational goals. It also aligns with the API Audit Checklist.  

---

### 1\. Security and Privacy

#### HTTPS Enforcement

* All APIs must enforce HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.  
* Sensitive information (e.g., tokens, credentials, personal data) must never be transmitted in URLs or query parameters. Use the request body for such data.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Implement RBAC using identity providers and enforce permissions within the API logic.  
* Document role-specific access controls in the API documentation.  
* **Maturity Levels**:  
  * **Foundational**: Roles are defined and access is manually enforced.  
  * **Growing**: Identity providers are integrated.  
  * **Scaling**: Dynamic role checks based on API consumers.  
  * **Innovating**: Automated, policy-driven RBAC enforcement.

#### OWASP API Security Compliance

* Address OWASP API Security Top 10 risks, including:  
  * **API6:2023 – Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**: Restrict sensitive business flows with proper authentication and authorization.  
  * **API7:2023 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Validate inputs and sanitize responses to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.  
  * **API2:2023 – Broken Authentication**: Ensure robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and validate token expiration workflows.

#### Encryption at Rest

* Sensitive data stored in databases must be encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms.  
* Validate that no sensitive data appears in logs or URLs.

### 2\. HTTP Methods

#### Standard Usage

* Use HTTP methods consistently:  
  * `GET`: Retrieve data without modifying server state.  
  * `POST`: Create new resources or trigger server-side operations.  
  * `PUT`: Update existing resources (use full resource payloads).  
  * `PATCH`: Partially update an existing resource.  
  * `DELETE`: Remove a resource.

#### Idempotency

* Ensure `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` methods are idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests result in the same state.

#### Testing HTTP Methods

* Validate all HTTP methods through integration tests to ensure compliance with expected behavior.

---

### 3\. Error Handling and Responses

#### Standardized Error Format

* All APIs must return errors in a standardized format. Example:

```
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "message": "The request is missing a required parameter.",
  "details": [
    "Parameter 'user_id' is required."
  ]
}
```

#### Verbose Descriptions

* Include human-readable error messages to help developers debug issues.  
* Ensure error codes and descriptions align with the OpenAPI Specification.

#### HTTP Status Codes

* Use appropriate status codes for each operation:  
  * `200 OK`: Successful GET, PUT, or PATCH operations.  
  * `201 Created`: Successful POST operation resulting in a new resource.  
  * `204 No Content`: Successful DELETE operation.  
  * `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input or missing parameters.  
  * `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failure.  
  * `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions.  
  * `404 Not Found`: Resource does not exist.  
  * `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.

#### Testing Error Scenarios

* Validate all error scenarios to ensure proper responses and actionable error messages.  
* **Maturity Levels**:  
  * **Foundational**: Basic error handling for major scenarios.  
  * **Growing**: Detailed error messages for all endpoints.  
  * **Scaling**: Automated error validation using test tools.  
  * **Innovating**: AI-driven insights for error patterns and predictions.

### 4\. Documentation and Developer Experience

#### Interactive Documentation

* Generate API documentation using the OpenAPI Specification (latest supported version).  
* Include examples for all endpoints to demonstrate request/response workflows.  
* **Maturity Levels**:  
  * **Foundational**: Static documentation with examples.  
  * **Growing**: Interactive, auto-generated documentation.  
  * **Scaling**: Developer tools for API testing.  
  * **Innovating**: Embedded developer environments for testing.

#### Getting Started Section

* Provide a "Getting Started" section in the documentation to guide new users through authentication, common workflows, and testing endpoints.  
* Use the Getting Started Guide Template as a reference.

#### Sandbox Environment

* Offer a sandbox environment that mirrors production schemas and error codes for testing.  
* Validate sandbox alignment through API audit tests.

---

### 5\. Naming Conventions and Standards

#### Resource Naming

* Use descriptive, industry-standard English terms for resource names (e.g., `books`, `users`, `loans`).  
* Avoid ambiguous terms like `type` or `status` without additional context.

#### Attribute Naming

* Use camelCase for attribute names (e.g., `userId`, `bookTitle`).  
* Avoid acronyms and abbreviations to ensure clarity.  
* Validate naming conventions during OpenAPI validation.

---

### 6\. Localization and Internationalization

#### Accept Headers

* Support localization using the `Accept-Language` header for API responses.  
* Provide localized strings and ensure all error messages can be translated.

#### Date and Time Formats

* Use ISO 8601 format for all date and time fields, including time zones.

```
"createdAt": "2024-12-21T10:00:00Z"
```

#### Testing Localization

* Validate localized responses and error messages through functional tests.

---

### 7\. Versioning and Deprecation

#### Versioning Strategy

* Use semantic versioning (e.g., `/v1`, `/v2`) to indicate major changes.  
* Avoid breaking changes within a version. Deprecate old endpoints with sufficient notice.

#### Deprecation Notices

* Communicate deprecations through the Developer Portal and include headers in API responses:

```
Deprecation: true
Sunset: 2025-01-01
Link: <https://developer.portal.com/docs/deprecation>; rel="deprecation"
```

---

### 8\. Pagination and Filtering

#### Pagination

* Use standard pagination parameters:  
  * `page`: Current page number.  
  * `limit`: Number of items per page.

#### Filtering

* Allow filtering by common attributes (e.g., `title`, `author`, `genre`):

```
GET /books?title=harry&author=rowling
```

#### Testing Pagination and Filtering

* Validate that pagination and filtering work as expected using API test cases.  
* **Maturity Levels**:  
  * **Foundational**: Support basic pagination and filtering.  
  * **Growing**: Ensure consistent behavior across endpoints.  
  * **Scaling**: Optimize performance for large datasets.  
  * **Innovating**: Intelligent filtering and predictive query support.

---

### 9\. Testing and Validation

#### Automated Validation

* Use tools like Spectral to validate OpenAPI specifications for completeness and consistency.

#### Error Testing

* Test error scenarios for all endpoints to ensure proper responses and actionable error messages.

#### OWASP Compliance Testing

* Test APIs against OWASP API Security Top 10 risks:  
  * **API6:2023 – Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**: Validate proper access restrictions.  
  * **API7:2023 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Validate inputs and responses to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.  
  * **API2:2023 – Broken Authentication**: Test token expiration, refresh workflows, and error handling.

### 10\. Refining and Validating the API Style Guide

#### Review and Feedback

* Conduct periodic reviews of the style guide with cross-functional teams (product, engineering, compliance).  
* Gather feedback from API consumers to address usability concerns.

#### Version Control

* Maintain the style guide in a version-controlled repository to track changes and ensure team alignment.

#### Integration with Development Workflows

* Embed style guide principles into API linting tools and CI/CD pipelines.  
* Regularly validate OpenAPI specifications against the guide using automated tools like Spectral.
